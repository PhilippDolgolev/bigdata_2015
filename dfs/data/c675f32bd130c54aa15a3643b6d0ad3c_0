MarkLogic Corporation (formerly Cerisent), or MarkLogic is an American software business that develops and provides an enterprise NoSQL database, MarkLogic. MarkLogic is a document-oriented database platform that has a schema-agnostic data model for storing and managing XML, JSON, RDF, and Geospatial data. It uses a distributed, scale-out architecture, provides ACID transactions, and maintains government-certified security.

The company has its headquarters in Silicon Valley with field offices in Chicago, Frankfurt, London, Munich, New York, Paris, Singapore, Stockholm, Tokyo, Utrecht and Washington D.C.

History
The company was founded in 2001 by Christopher Lindblad, who was the Chief Architect of the Ultraseek search engine at Infoseek, and Paul Pedersen, a professor of computer science at Cornell University  and UCLA, to address shortcomings with existing search and data products. At the time, it used the then-dominant XML document markup standard and XQuery as the query standard for accessing collections of documents up to hundreds of terabytes in size. Newer versions handle JSON data and use XSLT, and MarkLogic 8 will process data using JavaScript.

In May 2012, Gary Bloom joined MarkLogic as Chief Executive Officer. Prior to joining Veritas Software as CEO in 2000, Bloom held several senior positions at Oracle and was widely considered the successor to Larry Ellison.

MarkLogic is privately held with investments from Sequoia Capital, Tenaya Capital and Northgate Capital.

In 2012, MarkLogic was the vendor with the largest revenue for Hadoop/NoSQL Software or Services, with 13 percent of total marketshare.

For the 2012 London Olympics, the BBC used MarkLogic to power its Olympic Data Services, an application that had to be built in 12 months. "Given the timescales, this project would not have been achievable using a SQL database, which would have pushed the design towards more complete modeling of the data." BBC broke all traffic records during the 2-week games, 2.8 Petabytes on peak day, including more than 100m video requests.

Since 1 October 2013, MarkLogic has been used to help power the U.S. government healthcare.gov site.

Technology
MarkLogic is a NoSQL document database that has evolved from its XML database roots to embrace the "enterprise NoSQL" label. In addition to the distributed, scale-out architecture expected from a NoSQL database, it has role-based security features, JSON storage, direct use of Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), multiple indexing strategies and ACID consistency. It is the most popular native XML DBMS as of April 2013. The product combines a database, search engine and application services together in one platform.

MarkLogic features include replication, rollback, automated failover, point-in-time recovery, backup/restore, backup to Amazon S3, JSON, can run directly on Hadoop Distributed File System, parallelized ingest, role-based security, full text search, location services, geospatial alerting, RDF triple store and SPARQL query support.

MarkMail is a free public mailing list archive service that emphasizes interactivity and search analytics. Every search result shows a histogram traffic chart of the messages matching the query, and also the top matching lists and senders. MarkMail started in November 2007 with approximately four million email messages. As of 24 November 2013, the service claims inclusion of 66,058,071 messages across 8,761 lists, of which 2,975 were active lists. The archive includes complete list histories for Apache, FreeBSD, GNOME, Jabber, Java.net, KDE, Mozilla, MySQL, OpenOffice.org, Perl.org, PostgreSQL, Python, Red Hat, Ruby, W3C, and Xen, among others.
