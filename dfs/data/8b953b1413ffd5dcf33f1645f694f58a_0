Teradata Partners conference
Teradata holds an annual user group conference and expo known as Teradata Partners with keynote industry speakers, educational sessions led by customers and other vendors. The Teradata Partners Conference has been an annual event since 1985. The conference involves lectures and speeches on technical and business topics and announcements about new products.

Big data
Teradata began to associate itself with the term “Big Data” in 2010. CTO Stephen Brobst attributes the rise of big data to “new media sources, such as social media.” The increase in semi-structured and unstructured data gathered from online interactions prompted Teradata to form the “Petabyte club” in 2011 for its heaviest big data users.

The rise of big data resulted in many traditional data warehousing companies updating their products and technology. For Teradata, big data prompted the acquisition of Aster Data Systems in 2011 for the company’s MapReduce capabilities and ability to store and analyze semi-structured data.

Public interest in big data resulted in a 13% increase in Teradata’s global sales.

Competition
Teradata's main competitors are similar products from vendors such as Oracle, IBM, Microsoft and Sybase IQ. Also, competitors include data warehouse appliance vendors such as NetezzaTeradata decides to compete head-on as a data warehouse appliance vendor (acquired in November 2010 by IBM), DATAllegro (acquired in August 2008 by Microsoft), ParAccel, Greenplum (acquired in July 2010 by EMC), and Vertica Systems (acquired in February 2011 by HP), and from packaged data warehouse applications such as SAP BW and Kalido.
