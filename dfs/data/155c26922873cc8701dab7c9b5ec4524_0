In the fields of information technology and systems management, IT Operations Analytics (ITOA) is an approach or method applied to application software designed to retrieve, analyze and report data for IT operations. ITOA has been described as applying big data analytics to the IT realm. In its Hype Cycle Report, Gartner rated the business impact of ITOA as being ‘high’, meaning that its use will see businesses enjoy significantly increased revenue or cost saving opportunities.

Definition
IT Operations Analytics (ITOA) (also known as Advanced Operational Analytics, or IT Data Analytics)  technologies are primarily used to discover complex patterns in high volumes of often "noisy" IT system availability and performance data. Forrester Research defines IT analytics as "The use of mathematical algorithms and other innovations to extract meaningful information from the sea of raw data collected by management and monitoring technologies."

Applications
ITOA systems tend to be used by IT operations teams, and Gartner describes five applications of ITOA systems: 
 Root Cause Analysis:  The models, structures and pattern descriptions of IT infrastructure or application stack being monitored can help users pinpoint fine-grained and previously unknown root causes of overall system behavior pathologies.
 Proactive Control of Service Performance and Availability: Predicts future system states and the impact of those states on performance.
 Problem Assignment: Determines how problems may be resolved or, at least, direct the results of inferences to the most appropriate individuals or communities in the enterprise for problem resolution.
 Service Impact Analysis: When multiple root causes are known, the  analytics system's output is used to determine and rank the relative impact, so that resources can be devoted to correcting the fault in the most timely and cost-effective way possible.
 Complement Best-of-breed Technology: The models, structures and pattern descriptions of IT infrastructure or application stack being monitored are used to correct or extend the outputs of other discovery-oriented tools to improve the fidelity of information used in operational tasks (e.g., service dependency maps, application runtime architecture topologies, network topologies).

Types
In their Data Growth Demands a Single, Architected IT Operations Analytics Platform, Gartner Research describes five types of analytics technologies: 
 Log analysis
 Unstructured text indexing, search and inference (UTISI)
 Topological analysis (TA)
 Multidimensional database search and analysis (MDSA)
 Complex operations event processing (COEP)
 Statistical pattern discovery and recognition (SPDR)
