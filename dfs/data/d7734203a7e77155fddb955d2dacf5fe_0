Financing

The company received seed funding from NetService Ventures later that same year. They also received angel funding from Roger Ehrenberg of IA Capital in early 2008. In February 2008, they received $3 million in Series A funding led by Trinity Ventures. In October 2008, they acquired Illuminex, a video analytics company founded by Jason Lopatecki and Adam Rose, for an undisclosed amount. They raised a combined $10 million in their Series B round in March 2009, led by Foundation Capital.  In December 2012 they raised $28 million in the first tranche of their Series C, led by Northgate Capital.

IPO
TubeMogul filed its S-1 form with the SEC on March 26, 2014.

On July 18, 2014 TubeMogul became a publicly traded company. They made 6.3 million shares available to investors at $7 per share to raise a total of $43.8 million in their initial offering.  The company listed with the NASDAQ Global Select Market using the ticker symbol "TUBE". TubeMogul became the first and currently the only enterprise software company offering programmatic digital brand advertising to be publicly traded.

Company History
TubeMogul was originally founded as a cross-platform online video analytics tool in 2007. Video producers uploaded content through TubeMogul, which would then distribute and track performance across video sharing sites.  In 2010, TubeMogul launched Playtime, an online video ad network, to help advertisers deliver ads to their target audience. Playtime differentiated itself from other online ad networks by its self-serve aspect as well as the level of transparency it provided.  In 2011, TubeMogul combined the Playtime ad network with the video syndication platform to effectively become a demand-side platform (DSP) for brand advertisers. TubeMogul’s DSP aggregates multiple inventory sources, including advertising exchanges, supply-side platforms and advertising networks, allowing advertisers to integrate pre-negotiated deals with publishers. In 2012, TubeMogul introduced its BrandSafe technology, which ensured that advertisements did not appear alongside objectionable content or run in small video players.  In 2013, TubeMogul launched BrandPoint, which allows marketers to execute digital video buys on a gross rating point (GRP) basis, traditionally used by TV advertisers to measure a campaign’s effectiveness. Unlike programmatic solutions that cater to both the buy-side (advertisers) and sell-side (publishers) as well as various marketing objectives (direct response and branding), TubeMogul specializes in brand, or video, advertising and is solely aligned with advertisers.

Industry Initiatives

Open Video Viewability (OpenVV)
In May 2013, TubeMogul and several other advertising technology vendors formed the Open Video View (OpenVV) consortium to help facilitate the adoption of a viewability standard for online video advertising. OpenVV is an open-source code that provides marketers verification that their ad was actually seen by human eyes and reasons for non-viewability. TubeMogul founded the initiative along with video technology vendors BrightRoll, Innovid, SpotXChange, and LiveRail; current members include Nielsen, comScore, TrustE, and VivaKi.

Fraud/Fake Pre-Roll
In 2011, TubeMogul launched fakepreroll.com to raise awareness about video ads that were shown in inventory normally reserved for display advertisements, oftentimes without the marketer’s knowledge.
The site was taken down after several companies sent TubeMogul cease-and-desist orders.

Botnet Detection
In 2014, TubeMogul reported the existence of three botnets, responsible for defrauding advertisers for a potential $10 million each month.

IPG Internship
In March 2014, IPG Mediabrands and TubeMogul announced the “Ad-Tech Apprenticeship,” a one-year intensive training program designed to give college graduates a holistic view of the digital advertising industry.
