To derive meaning out of vast amounts of data generated by machines, Flutura developed a patent pending platform called Cerebra. Cerebra does not only harvest signals from machines in real time, it gives the product users absolute visibility of their operations and empowers them with the ability to choose how they want to act in different scenarios. The unique ability of Cerebra to capture important signals from complex machine generated logs and harness previously untapped data makes it the future generation intelligent Big Data platform.
