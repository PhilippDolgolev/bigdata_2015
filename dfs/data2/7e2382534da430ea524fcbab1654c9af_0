Hopper provides insightful, data-driven research to help travelers make better decisions about where to go, and when to fly and buy.

History
Hopper is a big-data start-up  that was founded in Montreal, Canada, in 2007 by CEO Frédéric Lalonde, CTO Joost Ouwerkerk, and developer Sébastien Rainville with the goal of becoming "the Google of travel."

The company is currently headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the Kendall Boiler and Tank Company building, and also maintains an office in Montreal.

Funding
In 2008, the company secured $2 million in funding. In 2011, a second round of funding secured $8 million from Atlas Venture and Brightspark Ventures. The next year, Hopper secured $12 million from OMERS Ventures.

Hack/reduce
In May 2012, Hopper CEO Frédéric Lalonde and entrepreneur Christopher P. Lynch founded Hack/reduce, a non-profit hacker space designed to attract and foster big-data talent in the Boston area. Hack/reduce, which is located in the same building as Hopper's offices, has partnered with MIT, CSAIL, and Harvard, and has received a grant from Governor Deval Patrick as part of his Massachusetts Big Data Initiative.
