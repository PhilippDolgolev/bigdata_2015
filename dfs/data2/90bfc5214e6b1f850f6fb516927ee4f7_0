VoloMetrix, Inc. is an American enterprise software start-up based in Seattle, Washington. VoloMetrix offers a people analytics solution that combines data from collaboration platforms to create data visualizations and dashboards. At the end of April 2013, the company raised $3.3M in series A funding from Shasta Ventures. In October 2014, VoloMetrix announced a series B funding round with Shasta Ventures and Split Rock Partners that raised $12M.

 Company Team 
The company was founded in 2011 by Ryan Fuller, the company's CEO, and Chris Brahm, a board member. The team includes Nimrod Vered (VP of Engineering), Chantrelle Nielsen (VP of Customer Solutions), and a staff of approximately 20 employees. Jim Simons, Managing Director of Split Rock Partners, joined the VoloMetrix Board of Directors following the series B funding round.

 Technology 
VoloMetrix extracts and analyzes anonymous data from company email, calendar, social platforms and line-of-business applications. They enable executives, managers and individuals in any organization to clearly understand where their teams are focused and how they can work together most effectively through easy-to-use, interactive dashboards. The application and integrated professional services work together to diagnose and resolve company-wide issues such as tracking bottlenecks, and providing a more dynamic view of the organization than a classic org chart can provide. VoloMetrix solutions can be used to change the way functions across the organization manage their business, including HR, Finance, and IT. Companies can fuel innovation and accelerate profitable growth by treating time as a scarce resource and being mindful about how they invest it.

 Patent 
In August 2014, VoloMetrix publicly announced that it had filed a patent for its proprietary technology and associated metrics. VoloMetrix's key organizational metrics include Organizational Load Index (OLI), Fragmentation, Network Efficiency Index, and other measures aimed at improving employee performance.
